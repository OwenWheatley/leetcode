### Step by Step Breakdown:
1. Initialize a `freq` dictionary (using `defaultdict`) to store the frequency of characters within the current window of the substring.
2. Initialize two pointers, `leftP` and `rightP`, where `leftP` tracks the left boundary of the window and `rightP` tracks the right boundary of the window. Also, initialize `ans` to count the total number of valid substrings.
3. Iterate through the string `s` with `rightP`:
   - Add the character `s[rightP]` to the `freq` dictionary, updating its frequency.
   - Check if any character in the current window appears at least `k` times using a condition `any(freq[char] >= k for char in freq)`. 
   - If this condition is true, increment the result `ans` by the number of substrings that can be formed between `leftP` and the end of the string (calculated as `len(s) - rightP`).
   - Then, move the `leftP` pointer to the right by decreasing the frequency of the character at `leftP` and removing it from the dictionary if its frequency drops to zero.
4. Continue the process until all substrings are examined.
5. Return `ans` as the total number of substrings where at least one character appears at least `k` times.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the length of the string. The `rightP` pointer iterates through the string, and for each position, the `leftP` pointer may move through the rest of the string.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, since the frequency dictionary `freq` can store up to `n` characters.

### Code Snippet:
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubstrings(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        leftP = 0
        ans = 0

        for rightP in range(len(s)):
            freq[s[rightP]] += 1

            while any(freq[char] >= k for char in freq):
                ans += len(s) - rightP
                freq[s[leftP]] -= 1
                if freq[s[leftP]] == 0:
                    del freq[s[leftP]]
                leftP += 1
        return ans
