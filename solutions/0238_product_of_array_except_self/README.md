### [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)
### Code Breakdown

1.  **Class and Method Definition**:


    `class Solution:
        def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:`

    -   A class `Solution` is defined, which contains a method `productExceptSelf`.
    -   The method takes an input `nums` (a list of integers) and returns a list of integers (`List[int]`).
2.  **Initialize the Result Array**:

    `res = [1] * (len(nums))`

    -   `res` is initialized as a list with the same length as `nums`, where every element is `1`.
    -   For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `res` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
    -   This array will eventually store the product of all elements of `nums` except for each element at index `i`.
3.  **Initialize Prefix Variable**:


    `prefix = 1`

    -   `prefix` is a variable that will hold the cumulative product of elements from the left side as we iterate through `nums`.
    -   Initially, it is set to `1` because the product of zero elements (before any index) is `1`.
4.  **First Loop: Calculate Prefix Products**:


    `for i in range(len(nums)):
        res[i] = prefix
        prefix *= nums[i]`

    -   This loop iterates over each index `i` in `nums` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

    -   **`res[i] = prefix`**:

        -   `res[i]` is set to the value of `prefix`, which represents the product of all elements before `nums[i]`.
        -   For example, if `prefix` is `6`, it means the product of all elements before `nums[i]` is `6`, so `res[i]` is updated to `6`.
    -   **`prefix *= nums[i]`**:

        -   `prefix` is then updated to include `nums[i]` in the product.
        -   This means `prefix` will contain the product of all elements up to `nums[i]` for the next iteration.
        -   For example, if `nums[i] = 2` and `prefix` was `6`, after this line `prefix` becomes `12`.
    -   After this loop, `res` contains the product of all elements to the left of each index in `nums`.

5.  **Initialize Postfix Variable**:


    `postfix = 1`

    -   `postfix` is a variable that will hold the cumulative product of elements from the right side as we iterate backward through `nums`.
    -   It is initially set to `1` for the same reason as `prefix`.
6.  **Second Loop: Calculate Postfix Products and Final Result**:


    `for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] *= postfix
        postfix *= nums[i]`

    -   This loop iterates over each index `i` in `nums` from `len(nums) - 1` down to `0` (right to left).

    -   **`res[i] *= postfix`**:

        -   `res[i]` is multiplied by `postfix`, which represents the product of all elements after `nums[i]`.
        -   This effectively updates `res[i]` to include both the product of elements before `nums[i]` (stored from the first loop) and the product of elements after `nums[i]` (calculated here).
    -   **`postfix *= nums[i]`**:

        -   `postfix` is updated to include `nums[i]` in the product.
        -   This means `postfix` will contain the product of all elements from `nums[i]` onward for the next iteration.
    -   After this loop, `res` contains the final result, where `res[i]` is the product of all elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

7.  **Return the Result**:


    `return res`

    -   Finally, the method returns `res`, which is the desired list of products.
    
### Complexity

-   **Time Complexity**: O(n)O(n)O(n)
    -   Two passes through the `nums` array (one for `prefix` and one for `postfix`), each of which is O(n)O(n)O(n).
-   **Space Complexity**: O(1)O(1)O(1) (if we don't count the space used for the output array `res`)
    -   The algorithm only uses a few extra variables (`prefix` and `postfix`) regardless of the input size. The space used for `res` is not considered extra space because it is part of the output.
