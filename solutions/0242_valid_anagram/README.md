### [242. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1.  **Check Lengths**:


    `if len(s) != len(t):
        return False`

    -   **Purpose**: If the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` are not equal, they can't be anagrams, so we can directly return `False`.
    -   **Time Complexity**: `O(1)` since checking the lengths is a constant time operation.
    -   **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` since no extra space is used here.
2.  **Initialize Frequency Counters**:


    `countS, countT = {}, {}`

    -   **Purpose**: These dictionaries will store the frequency of each character in strings `s` and `t`.
    -   **Time Complexity**: `O(1)` because the initialization of empty dictionaries is constant time.
    -   **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` for initializing the variables, but this will grow as we store character counts.
3.  **Build Frequency Counts**:


    `for i in range(len(s)):
        countS[s[i]] = countS.get(s[i], 0) + 1
        countT[t[i]] = countT.get(t[i], 0) + 1`

    -   **Purpose**: Iterate through both strings simultaneously, updating `countS` and `countT` to store the count of each character in `s` and `t`.
    -   **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `s` (or `t`, since they are the same length). This is because we iterate through each character once.
    -   **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` for the loop control, but the space used for `countS` and `countT` will be `O(1)` if we assume a fixed character set like ASCII. In the worst case, if we assume an unbounded character set (like Unicode), it could be `O(n)`.
4.  **Compare Frequency Counts**:


    `for c in countS:
        if countS[c] != countT.get(c, 0):
            return False`

    -   **Purpose**: Iterate over each character in `countS` and compare its frequency with `countT`. If any character count differs, return `False`.
    -   **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` in the worst case, as iterating over `countS` involves checking each character count.
    -   **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` for the loop control, as the dictionaries are already built and we're not using extra space.
5.  **Return True if All Counts Match**:


    `return True`

    -   **Purpose**: If no discrepancies are found in the counts, return `True`, indicating `t` is an anagram of `s`.
    -   **Time Complexity**: `O(1)` since returning a value is constant time.
    -   **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

### Overall Time Complexity

The dominant operations are building the frequency counts and iterating through them:

-   **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` + `O(n)` = `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `s` (or `t`).
-   **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` in the worst case (if we count storage for characters in the frequency dictionaries).

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        
        countS, countT = {}, {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            countS[s[i]] = countS.get(s[i], 0) + 1
            countT[t[i]] = countT.get(t[i], 0) + 1
        for c in countS:
            if countS[c] != countT.get(c, 0):
                return False
        return True
