### Step by Step Breakdown:
1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of open brackets encountered during the traversal of the string `s`.
2. Create a dictionary `closeToOpen` to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket (e.g., `")": "(", "]": "[", "}": "{"`).
3. Iterate through each character `c` in the string `s`:
   - If `c` is a closing bracket (i.e., it's in the `closeToOpen` dictionary):
     - Check if the stack is not empty and if the top element of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket from `closeToOpen`. If so, pop the top element from the stack.
     - If the stack is empty or the top element doesn't match, return `False` because the string is not valid.
   - If `c` is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
4. After iterating through the entire string, return `True` if the stack is empty (meaning all brackets were matched and closed correctly), or `False` if the stack still contains unmatched opening brackets.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string once, and stack operations (push and pop) take constant time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**, as we may need to store up to `n` opening brackets in the stack.

### Code Snippet:
```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        closeToOpen = {")": "(", "]": "[", "}": "{"}

        for c in s:
            if c in closeToOpen:
                if stack and stack[-1] == closeToOpen[c]:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                stack.append(c)
                
        return True if not stack else False
